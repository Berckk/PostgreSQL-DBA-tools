This is a set of Linux scripts and PostgreSQL 9.4
queries by Melvin Davidson. They were shared on the
pgsql-general mailing list on 26 May 2015.

CAVEAT EMPTOR! 
Please DO NOT write to me asking me why I did things one 
way when you think it should be done another way, 
or way I chose specific values for a query. 
There are several available editors you can use to make your own changes.

IOW: Do not peer into the oral cavity of an equestrian present!
